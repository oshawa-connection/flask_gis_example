# Flask Example

An example Flask app that reads some GIS data from POSTGIS and returns it as a GeoJSON. The extent is limited 
to a bbox to limit the number of features that can be returned in a single query.

## Example route

To test out some example routes, try the following.

Should return some geojson data:

[http://localhost:5000/api/ospostcodes?extent=-358183.914544,7544263.629197,-355305.209470,7548213.870932](http://localhost:5000/api/ospostcodes?extent=-358183.914544,7544263.629197,-355305.209470,7548213.870932)

Should return "Extent was too large" because it is a large requested area:

[http://localhost:5000/api/ospostcodes?extent=-355305.209470,0,0,7548213.870932](http://localhost:5000/api/ospostcodes?extent=-355305.209470,0,0,7548213.870932)

If you flip the coordinates, it will also return an error:

[http://localhost:5000/api/ospostcodes?extent=10,10,0,0](http://localhost:5000/api/ospostcodes?extent=10,10,0,0)

# Running for development

Download the [postcodes](https://osdatahub.os.uk/downloads/open/CodePointOpen) dataset, load them into a POSTGIS table

Schema name: os_data

Table name: codepo_gb_code_point_open

To run the app:
```bash
docker build -t gis_flask_example .
docker run -dp 5000:5000 -e DATABASE_URL="postgresql://host.docker.internal/DATABASE_NAME?user=USER_NAME&password=PASSWORD" gis_flask_example
```

If you go to [http://localhost:5000/healthcheck](http://localhost:5000/healthcheck) you should get a `Healthy` result if the app can connect to the database all ok.

## Configuration

While developing, on Mac or Linux, use [autoenv](https://github.com/hyperupcall/autoenv).

# Testing

There is a single test suite under models/extent_tests.py that you can run like this:
```bash
python3 models/extent_tests.py
```

# Notes

1. This is my first ever flask app, so please be kind. If you want to see an example app in a framework where I know what I am doing, please see [Amici](https://github.com/oshawa-connection/amici)
2. This whole app works only for EPSG:3857. It does not work at the x wraparound, which is ok for now because all data is in the UK.
3. I attempted to follow pep8 but python environments and pylint on my (8 year old) computer are a little messed up as I didn't take care when I was learning to program!
4. There should be a logger service, but I didn't have time.
5. I am going through a phase where I have fallen out with ORMs and prefer to do things in raw queries - talk to me about it!
